# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, <br/> I'm Andrea Cataldo.

### Iâ€™m a mobile engineer with a focus on application and mobile platform engineering.
<!-- 
### Currently, I help build [Modal](https://modal.com/), a dream cloud platform for data & ML engineers.
<br>
-->

<br>

I can usually be found in a programming IDE or studying.
I'm bullish on, and a big booster of:

- Critical Thinking. Analyze, not accept. Examine, not ignore. Understand, not assume.
- Personal finance: Plan, don't guess. Track, don't ignore. Invest, don't speculate.

<!-- 
- ðŸŒ¿ðŸ’š [@bazelbuild](https://github.com/bazelbuild/) and generally using functional principles to keep things sane. (I've open-sourced a few tools for the Bazel ecosystem, see [/projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects))
- Good old-fashioned books ðŸ“–. Two recent favourites are [_The Dispossessed_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13651.The_Dispossessed) and [_Coders at Work_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6713575-coders-at-work)
- [Effective Altruism](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/6/20992100/peter-singer-effective-altruism-lives-you-can-save-animal-liberation). Helping, not harming. Doing, not having. Building, not consuming.
